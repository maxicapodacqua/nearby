Nearby API, to search nearby phone area codes

## Goal of this project
Trying to implement an API that will return data from a database without using any external go modules 
(or the least amount of modules). 

The idea is to work on a project from a scratch to get familiar with the golang ecosystem, development cycle and tooling
